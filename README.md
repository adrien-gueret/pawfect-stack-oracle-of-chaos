## Oracle of Chaos

You are a cat. Probably the most beautiful one of all, let's be honest. But today, you're worried. Your human has taken on a young witch to tidy up his cellar. And you don't like that one bit! As a proper cat, you'll do everything in your power to make her life difficult. Sounds easy enough, right? But that's without taking into account the little witch, who won't let herself be pushed around — and she's got more than a few magic tricks up her sleeve…

## About items...

In this game, you’ll have to deal with magical items. Some of them have special properties:

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a200a559-81ec-4a41-a8b7-3b17e35ab95c" style="image-rendering:pixelated" /> Potion

Very fragile. If another item falls on it, or if it falls by itself, it will break.  
Drop other items onto these potions... or push them into the void!  

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637b6bc0-72d6-48af-ba7f-e5da5ef5324e" /> Grimories

The more grimoires are placed next to each other, the higher their magic score will be.  
Try to keep grimoires apart.

Needs water. When watered, it will grow if there’s enough space, increasing its magic score.  
Block them to stop them from growing as they should!

## Tricks

The cat can pull off a few tricks.  
Each trick is free! But don't forget: every time the witch casts _Hydravo_ on you, you **must** use the _Move_ trick to return to the cellar...

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715cf8b7-12d2-4481-bc05-d8219eafecdc" /> Move

Move the cat anywhere you want in the cellar. If any objects are placed above him, they’ll fall!

### <img width="48" height="48" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9afdf3b-98ce-42f4-9585-fb2cee6f1ca5" /> Push to left/right

Push any items in the cellar one column to the left or right. Useful for making items fall and disrupting the witch’s tidying.
